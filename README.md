# SpamBot

## Info

####   What is this?
Its just a simple Python bot I copied and improved from this [YouTube video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk4iM-Zs5RY)

#### What does this do?
Pretty obvius, it spams words from a file into the coords you config.

## Usage
* First, you will need to get a wordlist to spam. Find it yourself, do whatever you want.
* I recommend spliting it in a word per line format. I used Mousepad to do so, but there are other tools.
* Find the coords of the field you want to type running the file named ```find_coords.py```
* Once you have found what coords are, open ```spambot.py``` and go to the CONFIG section. Replace the coords with whatever the new coords are

### Notes
* This bot stops manually, so make sure you have the terminal near. Then, type CTRL + C over the terminal window
* It is not natively compatible with Windows, but it can be really easily fixed.
